## SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

1. Software engineering is the process of developing and managing software applications from ideation to completion, and then also the maintenance of the said software. 
    - Software engineering differs from traditional programming as tradition programming only deals with passing instructions to the computer system to perform specific tasks and does not include the other processes of planning and managing the programs as does software engineering.
    - Software Development Life Cycle involves all the process involved in developing a software.
3. Phases of Software Development Life Cycle involves:
    - Ideation: This is the process of planning and preparation for the project
    - Design: This invloves creating a prototype of the software to be developed
    - Development: This is the actual process of developing the software
    - Testing: This is process of checking that the software works effectively the way it should work
    - Deployment: This is the process of making the software available for use
    - Maintenance: This involves a stage where the software is improved upon

        - Agile Model invloves breaking the software project into small bits where each bit is worked on iteratively.
        - Waterfall model invloves the comletion of one phase of software development before another phase begins.
4. For Agile methodology, different teams can simultaneously work on different phases of the project while for waterfall, everyone have to work together on each phase before proceeding to the enxt one.
    - Waterfall is suitable for projects with a clear sight of the endgoal while for agile methodology is suited for projects which is susceptible to change.

## REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING

1. Requirements engineering is the process of converting clients needs into detailed steps that can fit in the software development life cycle.
The processes involved include:
    - Familiarization with the project details
    - Specifying the tools and other requirements of the project.
    - Ensuring the projoct is built according to the clients' needs
    - Ensuring al other processes work as they should
Requirements engineering is important in the sftware development life cycle as if forms the basis for its processes.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

1. Modularity invloves breaking down the complex project into simpler tasks.
    - Modularity improves maintainability and scalability as each simpler tasks is worked on at a time which makes the whole process faster instead of working on the complex project at once.

## TESTING IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

    - Unit Testing: this invloves testing each component of the software
    - Integration testing: this involves testing the functionality of two or more components of the software together
    - System testing: this invloves testing the software as a whole to make sure it works as it should
    - Acceptance testing: this involves making sure that the software meets the requirements it was developed for

Testing is crucial in software development as it helps in detecting faults in the software before development and also helps improve the quality of the software

## VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS

- Version Control Systems are systems that keep records of changes to a file(s) and can help help revert to previous versions at a later date. 
- Version Control Systems are important in software engineering as it helps to keep record of changes done on the software code.
- Examples of popular version control systems and their features are:
    - Git: it is open-sourced and can be accessed by other users/programmers when it is hosted in a remote repository.
    - Apache Subversion: it is a more advanced version control sytem where the central repository is the most important in which it should be handled with utmost care

## SOFTWARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT

- Software project manager is the person who serves as the intermediary between the client and the software development team and other who are involved in the software development. He/She also oversees the whole project from start to finish.

- Responsibilities and Challenges
    - Oversees the whole project
    - Monitors the project
    - Documents the project processes
    - It can be time consuming as they manage both clients and the software development team
    - It can be mentally draining as you see to cmplete the project in due time

## SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE

- Software maintenance is the process of keeping the software up to date as the need arises. The different types of maintenance activities include:
    - Corrective maintenance: this type of mainteannce is carried out when there is a defect in the software
    - Preventive maintenance: this involves forseeing faults that may arise and working on them so that they will not occur
    - Perfective maintenance: this involves adding new features to the software to make it better
    - Adaptive maintenance: this invloves changing the software development tools while ensuring the software still works as it should

- Maintenance is essential in the software lifecycle as it helps to keep the software relevant and useful for its prupose(s)

## ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

- Some of the ethical issues software engineers may face include:
    - Data privacy: ensure proper consent is requested fom users before collecting their information
    - Accessibility: ensuring that the software is available to everyone who wants to use it
    - Security: make sure the software is comfortable for its users

- Ways in which software engineers can adhere to ethical standards include:
    - Using the proper tools in the software development process
    - Ensure due processes are followed during the whole software development process
